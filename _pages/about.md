My research invents unconventional approaches to lightâ€“matter interaction, combining nanophotonics with functional materials to develop transformative photonic platforms. By integrating self-assembly, advanced spectroscopy, and quantum optics, I build nanostructured architectures for energy harvesting, quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring.

Nanophotonics for Quantum and Sustainable Technologies
======
Addressing global challenges such as climate change and quantum technologies demands more than better materials - it requires a new paradigm in how we generate, direct, and manipulate light. While progress in photovoltaics and batteries has surged, nanoscale photonics remains underexploited. 

**Research summary**
My research interlinks four main themes, each building on the others: (1) Metamaterials to confine and manipulate light at the atomic scale; (2) Optoelectronics for IR-to-visible photon upconversion; (3) Quantum entanglement and spin dynamics in molecular systems; and (4) Applying these innovations to environmental sensing. Together, they form a coherent framework advancing condensed matter physics and enabling technologies across quantum information, energy, and climate science.
