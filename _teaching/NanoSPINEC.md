Using nanophotonic cavities, we will achieve the first room-temperature measurements of spin states at the 
single-molecule level, leveraging them to track the formation and decay of quantum correlations in exciton 
singlet fission (SF) and to establish the first chemical Bell inequalities through triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) 
and optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). 

This proposal leverages our recent advances in nanophotonics to control and probe quantum spin states at room temperature and the single-molecule
level. We aim to demonstrate the first room-temperature ODMR of single organic molecules in
nanocavities and use photoluminescence statistics to study entanglement in SF and TTA. Our approach
also provides a concrete route towards a Bell inequalities test in molecular systems, using TTA & ODMR.
If we succeed, our work will provide the first violation of such inequalities in a chemical system, a crucial
milestone in establishing molecular qubits as viable QIS platforms. Beyond QIS, our project is timely
and transformative as it advances scalable, self-assembled single-molecule ODMR, enabling new
sensing methods and insights into molecular spin dynamics with broad implications for spectroscopy
and optoelectronics
