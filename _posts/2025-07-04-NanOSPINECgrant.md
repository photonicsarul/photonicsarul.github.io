Happy to receive a new grant worth half a million pounds to lead an exciting collaboration between three different areas of the Cavendish - optoelectronics, nanophotonics, and quantum optics. 
This grant, with an equal amount awarded to our theory collaborators & partners in UCSD (Prof. Joel Yuen-Zhou) will run for three years and involve us trying to tackle a hard problem: how entangled are molecular excitons and how can we measure it!
Will be recruiting for a new postdoc soon and setting up a new laboratory and new experimental rig to measure single molecule optically detected magnetic resonance - stay tuned!
