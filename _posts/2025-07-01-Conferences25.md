Had a fun time this year at the [SPP11](https://spp11.tokyo/invited-speakers/) conference in Tokyo, giving my first invited talk on "Nanophotonics to control mid-infrared light and polariton condensation" and giving a contributed talk in [SCOM5](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/polima/scom5) on the new lanthanide research direction. 
Good feedback and great to see scientific colleagues and learn from the community - and get new ideas!
