A collaboration between the NanoPhotonics Centre in Cambridge and Bill Barnes' team in Exeter over few years lead to us 
understanding the fundamentals of interaction between polaritons and molecular vibrations within open cavity systems.
Fun to discover new physics in a system studied since the time of Lord Rayleigh!
Further details in the press links below from the Cavendish Laboratory and from APS itself.
